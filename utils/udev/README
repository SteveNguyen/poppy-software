Instruction for GNU/Linux only: how to build udev rules for Poppy's usb buses.
If you follow the standard architecture you should have 2 usb dongles (usb2ax) for controlling the motors.
One dealing with the upper body and one for the lower body.
The objective of this method is to automatically detect these dongles and assign them a constant name in /dev
in order to simplify the configuration file (no more tweak of the /dev/ttyACMx)

1/ plug one of the dongle, let say the upper body one.
   You can find its name with dmesg (the device should be assigned with a name /dev/ttyACMx)
2/ find the serial number of the device with lsusb -v
   you should be able to scan only the device with lsusb -v -D /dev/ttyACMx (x usually being 0 or 1).
   For the usb2ax the serial number looks like 6403635373035110A1D1
   You can also take note of the idVendor and idProduct.
3/ unplug the device and plug the second one in order to repeat the same procedure.
4/ once you have the serial numbers for both device, copy the file 99-usb_serial.rules to /dev/udev/rules.d/ (as root or sudo)
   and modify it with your serial number (if you don't use USB2AX you may also change the idVendor and idProduct)
5/ replug everything and your devices should be now linked to /dev/poppy_tbus and /dev/poppy_lbus (for top bus and leg bus).
   You can modify your configuration file accordingly in poppytools/configuration
