==============

Poppy is a kid-size humanoid robot designed for biped locomotion and physical human-robot interaction. It is based on a combination of standard dynamixel actuators, 3D printed parts and open-source electronics such as Arduino boards. Both the hardware (3D models, electronics...) and software can be freely used, modified and duplicated.

**Here you will find all the code we use to do experiments and demonstrations. These files are distributed under GPLv3 licence.**

If you are interested by the hardware, you can clone our [poppy-hardware-beta repository](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-hardware-beta).

## Important:
All the control of the robot is based on the use of the [pypot library](https://github.com/poppy-project/pypot), please refer to the documentation for its [installation](https://github.com/poppy-project/pypot#installation).
